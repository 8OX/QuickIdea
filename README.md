# READ ME

### What is this?
This is a toy CLI project I made to quickly organize and write down my thoughts and ideas. Ideas can be 
organized into colors when prompted for a topic. I purposely related topics into colors as I previosly made a 
flowchart of ideas with each subfield relating to an arbitrary color. If this doesn't work for you, you can name 
the topic whatever you like. As emphasised, this is a toy project â€“ just for fun! Roughly 80% of the code is 
just CLI aesthetics and a challenge to write my own command line cursor with <code>read</code> and 
<code>clear</code> bash commannds. Even though it's small, it's proven to be the one program I use daily because
waiting for software like Evernote to load eats at my soul 1 milisecond at a time. 

### How do I use it?

1. <code>git clone [REPLACE ME]</code> 

2. Create a flowchart of ideas, interesting subject, or whatever you want and name it <code>flowchart.jpg<code> You can create a flowchart on www.diagrams.net

3. (optional) color code subjects in your flowchat that fall in similar field, I.G. red = Node.js and MongoDB

4. Place the flowchart in the main folder

5. Run the program with <code>python3 idea</code>

6. (optional) Create an alias in .bash_profile I.G: <code>alias plan="cd ~; cd YOUR_PATH/; python3 ideabulb.py"</code>
